Back in 1945, Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins had a pretty great idea. See, they were big ice cream people. So while every other ice cream shop stuck with vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry, they decided to go big. Like, “let’s offer 31 flavors instead” big. Because ice cream should be an every day treat. And the people? Yeah, they loved that.

It's safe to say Burt and Irv’s passion made an impact. Fast forward about 75 years, and we’re over 1400 flavors strong. Which is… kinda crazy when you think about it. But the best part is, we’ve got flavors for everyone, for every day, and for every occasion. So, whether your kid’s team finally won a game, you found your left shoe, or you just got out of bed this morning, there's always a yay-worthy scoop ready for you. And we think that's pretty cool.
